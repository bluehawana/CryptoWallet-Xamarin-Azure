In this graduate thesis, I present a real-time data visualization system using a .Net Blazor static website or an App deployed on Azure Storage. The primary objective of this project is to explore the integration and interaction between Azure Functions, Cosmos DB, and SignalR Service to achieve seamless data updates on the static website. The system initiates a GET call to an API deployed on Azure Functions, which retrieves and displays data from a Cosmos DB collection on the website. As new data becomes available in the Cosmos DB collection, the system employs Azure Functions and SignalR Service to push updates to the static website in real-time without requiring a page reload. This study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of using these technologies in conjunction for the efficient display and synchronization of real-time data in a modern web application or an Application in .Net stack.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33759589/236803540-24eeb48e-8746-4fa4-82b0-6b81026b6f17.png)
